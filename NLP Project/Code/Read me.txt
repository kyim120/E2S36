README - Vision System Project (By Faizan Rasool and Anoosha Alina)

1. First, upload the entire 'project' folder to your Google Drive.
   This folder contains:
   - templates/index.html
   - static/uploads/
   - other required files

2. Then open your Colab notebook and mount your Google Drive:

   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')

3. Make sure your code (main.py) points to the correct drive path:
   Example: /content/drive/MyDrive/project

4. Install required libraries in Colab:
   !pip install fastapi uvicorn transformers torch torchvision torchaudio
   !pip install opencv-python pillow deepface pyngrok
   !pip install ultralytics

5. Edit the API Key in main.py with your OpenRouter key:
   API_KEY = "sk-or-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

6. Run the FastAPI server in Colab:
   !python main.py

7. Ngrok will print a public URL. Open that URL in your browser to access the app.

Thatâ€™s it!
